# City Identification Expert System
## Introduction
This Prolog-based project is designed as a simple expert system to identify cities based on a set of special questions. The system employs a rule-based approach to infer the most likely city based on the provided attributes.

## How to Use
To use the system, simply start Prolog and consult the file containing the project code. Then initiate the program by calling the go predicate. 

The system will prompt you with questions about the attributes of the city you are trying to identify. Respond to these questions with 'yes' or 'no'. Based on your responses, the system will make guesses until it concludes.

City Identification Rules
The system employs a set of rules to classify cities based on their attributes. Each city has specific characteristics associated with it, which are used to narrow down the possibilities.

Supported Cities:
Dammam
Riyadh
Abha
Al Baha
Makkah
Medina
Jeddah
Al Qassim
Rules for Classification
For each city, there are specific attributes that are used for identification. These attributes include geographical location, cultural significance, landmarks, universities, and more.

How to Ask Questions
The system asks questions about various attributes associated with cities. You can respond with 'yes' or 'no' to each question. These responses help the system narrow down the list of possible cities.

Dynamic Predicate Handling
The system handles predicate assertions dynamically during execution. This allows for the addition or removal of facts/rules during runtime, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the expert system.

## Note
Remember to respond accurately to the questions asked by the system to ensure the most accurate identification of the city.
